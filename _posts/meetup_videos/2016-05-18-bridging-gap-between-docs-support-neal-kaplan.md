summary: "User assistance (documentation) is basically self-service customer support. Both documentation and customer support are critical to the success of any company, and they work better when they assist and improve each other. How can you tap the knowledge of support agents to improve the documentation, and how can you make the lives of support agents easier in return?"

User assistance (documentation) is basically self-service customer support. Both documentation and customer support are critical to the success of any company, and they work better when they assist and improve each other. How can you tap the knowledge of support agents to improve the documentation, and how can you make the lives of support agents easier in return?

Neal Kaplan has worked closely with customer support and customer success teams for years. He's gone from thinking of them as “the RTFM, turn-it-off-an-on-again folks” to being their biggest advocate and fan.

How can a documentarian work with customer support?

* Review support tickets manually
* Set up automated notifications
* Review difficult cases and solutions with customer support agents
* Learn about your customers
* Review ticket metrics, and measure how they change as you add more documentation
* Have them write

Join us for a lively presentation and discussion about the best ways to integrate support and documentation.
