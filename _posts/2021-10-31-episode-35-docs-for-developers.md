summary: "In this podcast, we discuss the newly released book <i>Docs for Developers: An Engineer's Field Guide to Technical Writing</i> with Jared Bhatti, staff technical writer at Google, and Zachary Sarah Corleissen, staff technical writer at Stripe. This book on writing documentation focuses on the end-to-end writing process (from audience analysis to drafting, editing, publishing, and more) and is written specifically with developers in mind. The authors use the scenario of documenting Corg.li, an API that translates barks, as a common thread through each of the chapters."
